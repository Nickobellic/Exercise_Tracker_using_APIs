# Exercise_Tracker_using_APIs

This Python Code asks about exercises done by you as a sentence and uses Nutritionix API and its NLP algorithm to break down the sentence to exercises done by you along with Amount of Calories burnt and duration of the Exercise. Then, we get those details in JSON format and store those things in Google Sheets using Sheety API.
